// Enables logging easily - there is a default logger that saves the logged message to three different locations (sinks) - the console, a daily file, and a per execution file.
// The log levels can be specified with initialize function for the default logger, and in add_logger for all other loggers. If Uber_Logger::Off is specified as the log level
// for any of the sinks, then the correspoding sink will not be created and nothing logged to it (ie it wont create a new file if the sink is a file). The daily file sink
// persists between executions and a new file is created each day - the file is never truncated. The per execution file sink is truncated each execution of the program.
//
// The default logger can be used with macro xxxlog("message") macro where xxx is a single letter that specifies the log level of the message (ie ilog("message") for info log level).
// To add a new logger use add_logger and specify the name and the Log Levels for each sink. The logger can then be accessed anywhere using xxxlogc("logger_name","message")
// where xxx is a single letter that specifies the log level of the message.
//
// In the message you can use bracket substitution to specify value - for example ilog("This is a message with the number {}",i) where i is the value. Most types
// will work with this by default, but to get a custom type to work you just have to overload operator<< - see examples above. You can also specify and index in the
// brackets to specify which parameter goes in which brackets - ie ilog("This is a message with two numbers - the first is {1} and the second is {0}",second,first)
